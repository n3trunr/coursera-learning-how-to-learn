# I recently made the change over the course of 4 months from being someone who gamed around the clock to being productive and being able to reflect on my day and be happy of what i've done. And what I've done is so simple, and imma outline it for you right now.

> From what I've seen there are a lot of people who are procrastinator Kings/Queens, myself included. 

- [ ] Make a morning routine that you can commit to, don't pressure yourself too much. have this routine work for you and enable you to work your best towards your goals. 

- [ ] The benefits from running are insane, and a simple 20 min run/walk can have vast improvements ranging from cognitive to that upper back pain. Here is a link to the video that inspired me to start running for 20 minutes in the morning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVzKCk066g

- [ ] Social media, this is the biggest one. Personally i went through and engineered my media to reflect what the future me of the life I wanted would see. This only took my about 40 minutes, and has really helped improve my time management.

- [ ] Time management is really hard to do especially when every app is fighting for YOUR precious time. Ironically i use an app called RescueTime which is completely free and allows me to categorize and view how much time I spend online, and where I spend it. The graphs also give you a daily, weekly, and monthly option.

- [ ] Reading. This is the most valuable asset for learning, not only will it allow you to absorb information faster, but it will extend your willpower of focus. In addition reading is the ultimate source of knowledge. What you read in 1 month took someone 2-10+ years to write, and that investment has such a high return rate. Bonus: the research that has gone into that book before being written has probably extended many years of dedicated research.  

- [ ] Another one of my habits is the habit of setting habits, there are a lot of ways you can implement habits. The 20 second rule which works both for getting rid of bad habits and implementing ones that work for you. Stacking habits is also really big. It basically takes a pre existing habit no matter how small and allows you to add on to that. For ex. you brush your teeth every morning, floss after. if you find yourself procrastinating on that you can use the 3 second rule, which basically states that once you think of doing something count down from three and just start doing it.

- [ ] The 2 min rule is helpful as well, pretty much anything that I can complete in 2 minutes I do now.

- [ ] Finally I would recommend doing affirmation at a dedicated time. The cool thing about affirmations is it is relevant to whatever you want. And the power of it over a long period of time affects how you think about something. Even if you don't believe the words you are saying now, 1 year down the line your brain will believe them. 

- [ ] Growth mindset vs fixed mindset, try to be aware of any fixed mindsets you have and try to correct them, I tell myself "X is not true, and therefore I am actually..."

- [ ] the pomodoro technique.

> That's all, I could go on for much longer but I think this is all you need to get a good start. Oh and stay curious, always ask questions, even if the "answer" is already known, because answers change constantly in light of new information.
